activities and the time they spend on them. By logging, tracking, analyzing, and
summarizing the data, the app helps users become more productive and efficient
by identifying areas where they need to adjust their time allocation according
to their personal goals and targets.

#### Data Models

**User**

```js
{ name: { type: String, required: true }, username: { type: String, required: true }, email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }, password: { type: String, required: true }, photoURL: { type: String, default: "" }, time_created: { type: Date, required: true }, last_modified: { type: Date, required: true }, settings: { type: Array }, isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true }, }
```

**Activity**

```js
{ name: { type: String, required: true }, seconds_spent: { type: String, required: true }, }
```

**Record**

```js
{ label: { type: String, required: true, }, date: { type: Date, required: true, default: function () { const dateStr = this.label.split("@")[0]; return new Date(dateStr); }, }, last_modified: { type: Date, required: true }, owner: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User", required: true }, activities: [activitySchema], }
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Future Plans

- have a line chart to easily see trends for each activity in the past days
- allow user to input their own category names for activities
- allow user to selet a start and end date on the summary page

## Known Issues

- if multiple notifications and alerts was triggered they were placed on top of
  each other on the display
- charts page don't store the charts selected at refresh of the page
- user will be suddenly logged out when the token expires; no warning or option
  to continue session yet
